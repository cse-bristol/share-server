* Share Server
A single-file ShareJS server which uses a MongoDB backend.

Requires a running instance of [[http://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]] on localhost:27017, and a [[http://nodejs.org/][NodeJS]] installation.

Once those are available, all we can fetch our dependencies as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install
#+END_SRC

Then run the following to host a browser-channel socket on the given port:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node server.js 80; # 8080 Is the default port.
#+END_SRC

** Debian Service Install
This provides a systemd deamon called share-server and sets it to run on startup.

Clone share-server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Name must not include hyphens because systemd treats them in as special.
git clone git@github.com:cse-bristol/share-server.git /opt/shareserver;
#+END_SRC

Symlink the service file

ln -s /opt/share-server/shareserver.service /lib/systemd/system/shareserver.service
