* Share Server
A single-file ShareJS server which uses an ElasticSearch backend.

* Installation
** Dependencies
 + A running instance of [[https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch][ElasticSearch]] on localhost:9200.
 + A [[http://nodejs.org/][NodeJS]] installation.

Once those are available, we can fetch our other dependencies as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install
#+END_SRC

** Running
After getting dependencies, run the following to host a browser-channel socket on the given port:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node server.js 80; # 8080 Is the default port.
#+END_SRC

** Debian Service Install
This provides a systemd deamon called share-server and sets it to run on startup.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# CLone share server
git clone git@github.com:cse-bristol/share-server.git /opt/shareserver;

# install dependencies
cd /opt/shareserver;
npm install;

# Hard link the service file.
# (If you prefer you can use cp here. Symlinks don't work with systemd.)
ln /opt/shareserver/shareserver.service /etc/systemd/system/shareserver.service

systemctl enable shareserver.service
systemctl start shareserver.service
#+END_SRC
